## Study Notes

遇到的问题：

- 输入`javac PrintingChoices`后报错`error: Class names, 'PrintingChoices', are only accepted if annotation processing is explicitly requested
  1 error`. The right command should be `javac PrintingChoices.java`

  

## Study Drills

1. Add a printing statement at the end of the code to display the sentence “I am learning  Java the Hard Way!” But break it up like line 19 so that you only have two or three words in each String and plus signs between. Make sure the spaces get included!

```java
System.out.println("I am" + " " + "learning" + " " + "Java the Hard" + " " + "Way!" );
```
