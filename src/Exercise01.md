## Study notes

In this section, I've learned how to display a string on the computer and how to compile a java program. First you need to type the command **javac FirstProg.java** then **java FirstProg**.
The detail is very important for a programming newbie. Be careful what symbol you're typing while programming.	

## Study Drills

1. Change what is inside the quotes on line4 to include today’s date. Save the file once you have made your changes, compile the file and run it again.

   完成第一个任务时，iTerm2下报错

```java
javac: file not found: FirsProg.java
Usage: javac <options> <source files>
```

在finder中查看该文件位置，正确。估计是没有保存，重新保存后可以正常编译运行了

line4 code

```java
System.out.println("Today's date is Thursday, Feburary 27, 2020.");
```

2. Change what is inside the quotes on line3 to have the computer display your name.

Line3 code

```java
 System.out.println("I, Leigitwing, am determined to learn how to code.");
```
